# AsknBid Tech | Frontend Engineer Internship

[Dstreet Games](https://dstreet.games), a product by [AsknBid](https://asknbid.tech), is India's biggest stock market gaming platform. Dstreet gamifies stock market education through Portfolios & Dshots, 2 major game formats. We believe Dstreet Games is the fastest way to learn stock trading.

Dstreet Games was initially built by 2 LPU alumni [Khushboo Soni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khushboo-soni) & [Ujjwal Brahmin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ujjwal-brahmin-2a8321175). They started working on it when they joined us as interns. [Shiv Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivp0616), also an LPU alumni, was the mastermind behind the AWS Cloud Infrastrucure for Dstreet Games.

At Dstreet Games, you get to work with the best in class and the most competitive founding team : [Kamaldeep](https://linkedin.com/in/kamaldeep-j), [Khushboo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khushboo-soni) and [Ujjwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ujjwal-brahmin-2a8321175). We are looking for developers who are the builders of the 1st order. The ones who get a rush from creating things from scratch and take pleasure in watching users try to tear it apart through sheer volume and strange, unthinkable use cases. And when it breaks, they cannot sleep without finding that pesky little condition in some forgotten corner.

Founded by [Suresh Bavisetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suresh-bavisetti) (CSE '17 Dropout, IIT Madras) & [Paarth Dhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paarthdhar) (EE '14, IIT Roorkee) and backed by [ICICI Securities](https://www.icicisecurities.com) & a few other most respected investors, we are on a mission to drive 150 Million+ Indian retail investor participation over in stock markets over the next decade.

## What is the task about?
- This task is designed to help us assess your ability to work on some of the technologies that we use to build products at AsknBid and your ability to craft clean and performant code in the real world.
- For this task we have created a simple Web App using [React](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/). The Web App consists of a form and table, certain parts of the code are missing. You will need to complete these missing parts of the code to get the features work as expected.

## Getting Started
- Fork the lpu2021-frontend repository.
- Once you've successfully forked the repository, clone it to your computer.
- Run ```cd lpu2021-frontend/``` command in the terminal.
- You will need docker to run this project. Install docker by following the instructions in this [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Skip this step if you have already installed docker on your computer.
- Run ```docker-compose up --build``` command in the terminal to run this project.


## What you'll be doing
- **Task 1** : We have created a simple form through which a user can join a pool. You have to integrate this form with the API to ensure the data is posted when the user submits the form. You will find the endpoint and request details as comments in the code. You will find this form in ```client/src/pool/``` directory.
- **Task 2** : You have to perform basic form validation such as checking whether the form fields are empty and show appropriate alert messages to the user. Also show the api response in alert messages.
- **Task 3** : We have created a simple table to show the leaderboard of each pool to the user. We have added some static data to this table. Your task is to show the appropriate leaderboard data to the user. You will find the endpoint details to fetch this data as comments in the code. You will find the table in ```client/src/leaderboard/``` directory.

## Tips
1. Please follow clean code standards and best practices.
2. Please follow git best practices. We will be going through your commits.
3. You can explore the API by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser. Make sure the docker container is up and running.
4. All the information you will need to solve the above tasks can be found in the links below.
